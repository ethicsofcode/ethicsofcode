# ethicsofcode
An open-source boilerplate focused on creating a developer's code of ethics.

1. Just because we can, should we?

As a developer, I understand the key role of technology in humanity is to reach for the betterment of our species. I understand that the limitation of technology today is not bound by capability, but by human imagination. I accept that when I build something, I must question whether my actions are for the betterment of mankind.

2. Responsibility of unintended consequence.

As a developer, I promise to do my best to limit unintended consequences of the software I produce. If something arises, I will do everything within my will to find a solution to limit harm to other human beings.
